LECTURES 
SUMMARY: The series LECTURES contains extant records of Griffis's lectures in the form of published texts, typescripts, notes and ephemeral material. William Elliot Griffis had a long and busy career as a public lecturer on all subjects which interested him, often supplementing his lectures with exhibitions of artifacts or projection of lantern slide illustrations. This series represents only a fraction of his work as a lecturer: for the most part holdings are limited to MS volumes in which Griffis recorded early lectures (of biographical importance and therefore selected out despite their America/Europe subject matter); published transcripts of a few lectures and addresses; and notes or scripts (those that have survived date mainly from the 1926-1927 trip to Japan). In addition, this series contains some ephemera and publicity materials for lectures by Griffis. Newspaper accounts of lectures may be found in the BIOGRAPHICAL FILE.

SERMONS 
SUMMARY: The series SERMONS comprises a few materials - notes to sermons, clippings of printed versions, pamphlets - representing Griffis's work as a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed (Congregationalist) Church. It is to be expected that these works bear only a tangential, if a potentially interesting relation to Griffis's work on the Far East. (MANUSCRIPTS and PUBLISHED WORKS also contain materials which shed light on the relation between Griffis's Christianity and his Internationalism.) Some materials on sermons remain scattered throughout the unsorted America/Europe boxes.

MANUSCRIPTS 
SUMMARY: The series MANUSCRIPTS contains a variety of materials and material types representing Griffis's work in progress at various stages of completion. At the high end are galley proofs and completed typescript essays; at the low end are MS fragments and draft materials from projects never completed. Necessarily, there is some overlap between this series and NOTES AND SUBJECT FILES (q.v.). 
Most of Griffis's manuscripts to published works are not extant, having been retained or disposed of by their publishers. Only a few complete manuscripts to books or published articles may be found in this series. Most items are manuscripts to articles never published, or draft manuscripts of writings in progress. Some items, such as the manuscript of the essay "The Daimyo's Government" or the fragments of reminiscences on early days in Tokyo, are very valuable; many others are clearly less so. 
Because of this, and their generally ambiguous nature, these materials were not treated consistently by early archivists and researchers: some were removed to the more accessible early boxes, while others were overlooked or left as received. Since no attempt has been made to organize the manuscripts more systematically, their present order reflects nothing beyond the subject groupings used in the early boxes of the old arrangement. Numerous manuscripts treating American History or Europe may still be found in the America/Europe section. Occasionally the researcher may find a few source materials (not by Griffis) intermixed with manuscripts. More often, only coherent manuscripts were placed in this series and more fragmentary notes, intermixed with newspaper clippings etc., were removed to NOTES AND SUBJECT FILES (q.v.). Old folders were generally not preserved, even if they were Griffis's own, due to their decrepit condition and high acid content. On occasion such folders were photocopied to give researchers an impression of Griffis's working methods.

NOTES AND SUBJECT FILES 
SUMMARY: The series NOTES AND SUBJECT FILES is separated into two subseries for storage purposes, reflecting preservation needs of the materials. The Griffis Collection contains a large quantity of scattered notes mixed with source materials, which Griffis produced and collected either in preparation for specific works or on topics of general interest to him. It was his practice to gather these materials, either in improvised folders or in packets or "clutches," and save them for later review and consolidation. 
Smaller, relatively coherent groupings are stored as files, placed in the subseries FILE FOLDERS and described by project (when evident) or subject. Typically a file contains notes mixed with clippings and various ephemera. Whenever located, photographs, complete manuscripts, significant correspondence and other important items were pulled to appropriate series. As most subject files, however, contained few or no such materials, the files as preserved still offer a useful view of Griffis's working methods in identifying and researching subjects and refining his perspective and arguments. Considerable overlap may be expected between this series and others such as PRINTED MATERIALS - NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS or EPHEMERA. 
Larger packets could not be stored upright, and so have been saved as a separate subseries, BUNDLES AND CLUTCHES. These bundles tend to be much less focussed than the smaller files, often being nothing more than the collected clippings and memoranda of a given time frame, extraneous to whatever projects Griffis was working on concurrently. 
Significant quantities of similar materials with no apparent Japan or Far East subject connection remain in the America/Europe boxes of the collection.

PRINTED MATERIALS 
SUMMARY: The largest series in the collection, PRINTED MATERIALS joins together the bulk of printed materials collected by Griffis in his researches presently extant in loose form. (Bound volumes, books and pamphlets, may be found largely in the Rare Books collection under X-GRIF.) It comprises three subseries: PERIODICALS, PAMPHLETS AND PUBLIC DOCUMENTS; CLIPPED ARTICLES; and NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS. 
The subseries PERIODICALS, PAMPHLETS AND PUBLIC DOCUMENTS is the most diverse in its contents. It includes discrete published materials saved by Griffis in their entirety, mainly issues of journals and pamphlets. Also included in this subseries are a few items produced for public distribution in non-print formats, such as mimeographed translations of speeches from the Japanese Diet, or public documents relating to the Korean Independence Movement. Items have been sorted by title, with the exception of a limited number of pamphlets, which have been grouped together in more general subject categories to facilitate access (for example the groupings "Missions in Japan" and "Missions in Korea." Excluded from this subseries are photojournals (located in GRAPHIC AND PICTORIAL MATERIALS) and periodicals in Japanese (in JAPANESE LANGUAGE MATERIALS). 
NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS and CLIPPED ARTICLES are self-explanatory subseries. The Griffis Collection contains a large quantity of newspaper clippings which were separated out by earlier archivists and disposed into subject groupings: these survive intact in this subseries pending appraisal for further organization and preservation work. The researcher should be warned that there is scant order and substantial overlap among subject headings and folder contents in this subseries, reflecting the incomplete arrangement of the collection prior to this project. In particular, materials from later boxes in the old arrangement were often too miscellaneous to be given a specific subject heading other than "unsorted." CLIPPED ARTICLES contains articles clipped by Griffis from journals and magazines which have been deemed too significant to place amidst newspaper clippings: these are listed by author.

COLLECTED MANUSCRIPTS 
SUMMARY: Griffis was interested in original materials by his contemporaries for a variety of reasons: sometimes he was able to serve as an editor or intermediary between author and publisher; sometimes his expertise was consulted; and always his own research interests were rewarded by his study of works by Japanese associates and by other Westerners who worked in the field. This series reflects manuscripts gathered by Griffis which, falling into the last category, were retained by him and found their way into his papers. (More substantial manuscripts collected by Griffis not primarily for his own researches may be found in Group IV.) The materials appearing here fall largely into two groups: manuscripts dealing directly with Japanese or Far Eastern culture, history or personages, and materials gathered by Griffis in researching the careers of the Yatoi or of other Westerners in the Far East. 
Authors may be identified for some of these MSS, but the greater part of them cannot be attributed. The series has therefore been arranged alphabetically by title; or, when a title has been lacking, by interpolated title (subject). When the subject has been identifiable as a Yatoi, the entry has been glossed.

STUDENT ESSAYS 
SUMMARY: Among the most important and interesting groups of materials in the Griffis Collection are the 340 or so student essays. These are essays written in English for Griffis by students in Fukui and Tokyo (at the Kaisei Gakko), or for Margaret Clark Griffis in her two years as teacher at the Tokyo Government Girls' School (Kanritsu Tokyo Jo Gakko). These are school compositions, mainly in fair copy (some with minor corrections by Griffis or Margaret Griffis). In aggregate they reveal quite clearly what assignments Griffis (and Margaret Griffis) made: the typical early assignment was to write an autobiography or relate a folk-tale; Griffis also asked students to give accounts of the geography of their home provinces in Japan, and later essays delved into subjects in culture (including "Children's Games"; "The Money of Japan"; "Street and Shop Signs"; "Theater"), history, or historiography (for example, a comparison between Japanese and English approaches to history). Also assigned was the revealing topic "My First Impressions of Foreigners." Astonishingly proficient in English, the essays were clearly intended to serve multiple purposes. From the start Griffis found them useful as original source materials on the Japanese nation and culture. Now, they provide an unparalleled view not only into early Meiji Japan, but also into the methods of education Griffis introduced, the formidable powers - in language, learning, and critical ability - of these elite students, and the fascinating early results of this meeting between cultures and ideologies. 
The importance of these essays was early recognized, and almost all had been segregated from the main collection for preservation. Some bear the traces of gummed labels used to tip them into scrapbooks (they seem to have been removed by Katharine Johnson). The essays are arranged at the item level.

EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS 
SUMMARY: This series contains a mix of materials retained by Griffis, as was his habit, as both memorabilia and sources for research. The first folders listed contain materials saved from his work at the Kaisei Gakko in Tokyo (earlier called the Daigaku Nanko) from 1872 to 1874 or directly relating to that period; among other items they include autograph slips of his students in the Second and Third scientific classes (many of whose work appears in the STUDENT ESSAYS); an official script of a speech given at the Kaisei Gakko by the Meiji Emperor; and the contract, with translation, of Edward Cornes, a colleague of Griffis's. (The last item was presumably sent to Griffis at a later date as source material on the Yatoi.) Similarly valuable items reflecting on this period may be found among the NOTEBOOKS, the STUDENT ESSAYS, and in the Exhibition Boxes of the collection. 
Later folders hold materials collected by Griffis in connection with his general interests in Japanese education, such as statistical tables and school catalogues. Similar, if less substantial items may be found in EPHEMERA. Other materials bearing on Japanese education may also be found in PRINTED MATERIALS. In this series, items are listed in chronological order.

SCRAPBOOKS 
SUMMARY: The series Scrapbooks is among the most interesting in the Griffis Collection: typical of nineteenth century scrapbooks, they are bound volumes into which have been pasted all types of materials, most especially newspaper and journal clippings and ephemera. Because of the fragile condition of the scrapbooks, researchers are requested to use the microfilm version. These scrapbooks span the dates of 1859 to 1914 and chiefly concern Griffis's Asian interests. Two scrapbooks belong to Griffis's sons, Stanton Griffis and John Elliot Griffis. Additional scrapbooks can be found in the United States/Europe material.

GRAPHIC IMAGES 
SUMMARY: The distinction between GRAPHIC IMAGES and PHOTOGRAPHS in the collection is made for preservation purposes based on media type. If printed through a photochemical process, an item was placed in the PHOTOGRAPHS. This series, therefore, includes something of a mix of materials. One major category of great interest are the examples here of Japanese print images, including maps and books from the pre-Meiji era. (Woodblock print books may also be found amid the JAPANESE LANGUAGE MATERIALS; this series includes only print images). A number of maps of later origin are also in this series, as are printed photographs clipped from magazines, photo journals or photographic essays (if printed in ink on paper). Finally, a box of postcards is included in this series. For the most part, these are unposted cards of Far East Origin, collected by Griffis. At an undiscerning point in the collection's history, however, these were intermixed with postcard collections of non-Griffis provenance: an undiscerning number of cards have yet to be systematically identified (some are identifiable by addressee) and removed. Oversize items can be found in Box 127.

EPHEMERA 
SUMMARY: The series EPHEMERA contains various kinds of ephemera, almost all saved by Griffis as memorabilia of people or events. The more coherent and noteworthy groups of ephemera have been sorted by origin or subject and listed alphabetically. A second box contains the many meishi or calling cards collected and saved by Griffis, including calling cards of important or noteworthy Japanese. Two other photo boxes contain loose unsorted ephemera of comparatively lesser interest except as curiosities. A few loose fragments of other materials too minor to be sorted into series (such items as scraps of newspaper clippings or manuscript notes) also appear in these boxes.

WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS (1843-1928) FILES, 1858-1928 
ARRANGEMENT: Arranged by document type and within type, chronologically. 
SUMMARY: WEG's correspondence to his family members not only describes his current activities, but also reflects his innermost thoughts and feelings. Early letters to his sister Margaret reveal his church activities and the growing importance of religion to him. His letters written while a Union soldier in Maryland describe army life and his opinions of it. WEG's college years, 1865-1870, at Rutgers College and, afterwards, New Brunswick Theological Seminary in New Brunswick, New Jersey, are detailed in weekly letters home. His letters written from Japan between 1871 and 1874 are filled with social and political observations and comments. Correspondence during his later years are primarily from colleagues and regard his research interest in colonial Dutch America, among other things.

EAST ASIAN LANGUAGE MATERIALS 
SUMMARY: Materials primarily in Japanese were for the most part consolidated in this series for further review and appraisal. Only a few exceptions were made for easily identified items which clearly benefited from being placed in other series (for example, for Japanese language MSS which appeared with translations among Collected Manuscripts). The series is therefore highly mixed, including rare Japanese documents such as an 1848 graphic directory of arms and armaments; numerous calligraphed manuscripts of speeches and citations (presented as honoraria to Griffis, for example on his 1926-1927 visit); and miscellaneous Japanese language journals and other publications, including missionary publications. The series also includes a few documents in Korean and several religious texts in Chinese.

PHOTOGRAPHS 
ARRANGEMENT: Seven subseries belong in this series: Japan Photographs (JP), Korea Photographs (KP), China Photographs (CP), Taiwan Photographs (TP), Griffis Family Photographs (GFP), Griffis Related Photographs (GRP), and Lantern Slides. The China Photographs, Taiwan Photographs, Griffis Family Photographs, and Griffis Related Photographs are included in this finding aid. Please see separate finding aids for the Japan Photographs and Korea Photographs. Lantern slides were used in Griffis's lectures. Lantern slides of Far East interest were listed in the 1993 Survey (this list is available in the repository). 
Another nine boxes (plus two boxes of postcards properly belonging to Graphic Images) contain America/Europe photographs. 
SUMMARY: The photographs in the Griffis Collection are among its most important resources for researchers. Griffis was keenly interested in documenting and presenting history by means of image as well as text, and he acquired and saved a great number of photographs in a wide variety of formats. Many of these photographs were used as illustrations in his books and articles. They range from cartes-de-visite of associates, friends and contacts, through cabinet photographs (including a large number of cabinet photos of important Meiji-era statesmen) to larger prints showing landscapes, architecture and engineering works. Of particular interest are the early albumen-process photographic prints, including approximately 90 prints clipped from the pages of The Far East, the first English-language newspaper published in Japan (contemporary with Griffis's residence in Tokyo). All photographs found in the course of processing the collection were removed to this series for preservation. It should also be noted that not every photograph in the collection is properly of Griffis provenance; notably, images of Japanese students at Rutgers from the University Archives were early joined with similar pictures in the collection, and are now difficult to segregate.

General Smirnoff: "He was the General appointed by the Czar to have charge of the entire fortress at Port Arthur. General Stessel only superseded him because of his ranking superior, and being driven in from the outer works by the Japanese. This made it all the more bitter pill for Smirnoff to swallow when Stessel took sole authority to surrender HIS fortress, as Smyrnoff was utterly opposed to it." 
General Beili: "General Beili was in command of all the artillery at Port Arthur. His main charge was towards the sea side of the fortress. Under him were four Colonels operating the batteries toward the land." 
General Semynoff: "General Semynoff was in command of a portion of the artillery on the North of Port Arthur as a Colonel and did not learn of his promotion until after the surrender." 
General Irman: "General Irman was in command of a portion of the artillery in the outer fortifications of Port Arthur as a Colonel. He did not learn of his promotion until after his surrender." 
Admiral R. Wiren: "Admiral Wiren is of German descent and speaks English fluently. He was one year in the U.S. superintending the construction of the Battle ship Revitzan. He was afterwards instructor of one of the brothers of the Emperor. At the time of the sinking of the Russian Flag ship he was in command of the Bayan, and became the successor of Admiral Makaroff in command of the squadron at Port Arthur. He and his associates were opposed to the surrender. He is a member of the Lutheran church."

GRIFFIS RELATED MATERIALS 
SUMMARY: This sub-group is comprised of archival and published materials that were not part of the original William Elliot Griffis collection, but are related to Griffis or to contacts between the West and Japan during the Meiji and Taisho periods. The materials fall into two categories: 
1) Materials related to the Griffis Collection but not strictly derived from it. These include nineteenth-century Japanese materials originally acquired separately from the Griffis accessions, but removed to the collection or photocopied by earlier curators. Also included are materials originally from the Rutgers University Archives. These items were amassed by or document Griffis, other members of the Class of 1869, the Yatoi (early foreign employees in Japan), and the ryugakusei (early Japanese students at Rutgers University and other institutions). Some of the material dates from Griffis's days as a student at Rutgers (1865-1869), before he was employed in Japan. 
2) Scholarship based on or related to the Griffis Collection, dating from the early twentieth century to the present. 
Document types represented in the sub-group include correspondence, research, notes, diaries, pamphlets, periodicals, books, manuscripts, audio and videotapes, photographs, and sheet music. The sub-group dates from the late 1860s to the present and is roughly 5 cubic feet in size, but is expected to keep growing as more materials are added. The sub-group is arranged with the largest series first, and the rest following in decreasing size order. 
WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS FILES, 1865-1930 
ARRANGEMENT: Arranged alphabetically by sub-series according to document type. 
SUMMARY: Includes non-Japan related Correspondence (25 folders), mostly consisting of correspondence between Griffis and other members of the Rutgers Class of 1869. Also includes material photocopied from the Rutgers University Archives such as Griffis's Rutgers Alumni Biographical File (9 folders), which contain mostly publications about Griffis's life or articles written by him, correspondence, clippings; miscellaneous notes, and postcards. This series also includes Griffis's Rutgers Essays (11 folders) handwritten on a variety of subjects completed while he was an undergraduate at Rutgers. Finally, this series contains original manuscript materials and ephemera removed from the University Archives Class of 1869 (withdrawn April 1966, 2 manuscript boxes), relating to Griffis, or collection written by Griffis. From this material the sub-series, Clippings, Ephemera, and Articles Written by Griffis (or in some cases edited by him), Pamphlets and Miscellaneous items derive.

ARDATH BURKS FILES, 1950-1992 
ARRANGEMENT: Arranged alphabetically by sub-series according to document type. 
SUMMARY: Ardath Burks was a Rutgers professor of Political Science who is often referred to as the "Modern Griffis" because of his strong interest in Japan. He worked closely with former Griffis Collection curator Jerome Cooperman, the political science department, and many other researchers on the Griffis Collection from the 1950s until the early 1990s. Burks published several articles about the collection and acquired many contemporary academic publications relating to it. He assembled a large assortment of Catalogues from libraries and archives he visited, and Clippings from various Japanese and American newspapers. This series also consists of Correspondence between Burks and his colleagues, and a small amount of Ephemera from Burks' trip to Japan in 1976. This series is richest in published materials such as Manuscripts, Offprints, Pamphlets, and Periodicals dealing mostly with Griffis and Meiji Japan, but also including some modern topics, written in both Japanese and English. Burks also amassed various Research materials, such as microfilm copies and notes, pertaining to Griffis and the modern development of Japan.

DAVID MURRAY FILES, 1840-1911 
ARRANGEMENT: Arranged alphabetically by sub-series according to document type. 
SUMMARY: Professor David Murray was a native of Delaware County, New York, a graduate of Union College, and a member of many organizations centered in the New Brunswick community and Rutgers College. In 1863 he became a professor of mathematics and astronomy at Rutgers. It was at this time that Murray became interested in education in Japan. He prepared a paper on this topic, which received so much attention that he was invited to accept a position as an educational advisor to the Japanese government. He served in Japan from 1873 to 1879, and upon leaving, was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun by the Emperor. Later Murray became a trustee at Rutgers College. Much of this material seems to have come from the papers of David Murray, given to the Rutgers College Library at some point after his death. The rest of Murray's materials derive from the Rutgers University Archives Faculty Biographical Files, including Clippings, Correspondence, Japanese Language Materials and several books now included in the Griffis Related Books series to follow. Murray's files include Published Works, Pamphlets, and Miscellaneous items. David Murray also amassed a large collection of Japanese artifacts and oversize graphic materials (see Artifacts and oversized graphic series).

CLASS OF 1869 FILES, 1869-1930 
ARRANGEMENT: Grouped alphabetically by sub-series according to surname or document type. 
SUMMARY: Materials withdrawn from the University Archives comprise this series, from which the sub-series, Materials for the History of the Class of 1869 of Rutgers College follows. These materials were collected by William Elliot Griffis and his fellow classmates, compiled for Class of 1869 History, Published in 1916, as well as miscellaneous alumni correspondence and alumni biographical sketches. There is generally one biographical file pertaining to each class member, while those who were more notable and had a larger amount of material have their own sub-series to follow. Griffis's fellow class member, Rev. John Hart, was born 1843 in Bucks County Pennsylvania. One of Griffis's more influential classmates, he was treasurer of the class of 1869. He was ordained in the Dutch Reformed Church in 1872. His sub-series includes correspondence with Griffis and other classmates as well as material for the history of the Class of 1869, and his Rutgers Alumni Biographical File. Much of the correspondence dates from 1916, the year the class history was written. George W. Labaw was born in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, in February 1848. A clergyman and author, he attended the Theological Seminary in New Brunswick from 1870 to 1873. His sub-series includes correspondence, mostly between himself and other classmates in 1916, material for the History of the class of 1869 , and a Rutgers Alumni Biographical file.

JAPANESE STUDENTS FILES, 1869-1970 
ARRANGEMENT: Grouped alphabetically by surname or document type. 
SUMMARY: Even before the restoration of the Meiji Emperor to power in 1868, a few Japanese had ventured abroad to study. The most famous among them have their own sub-series to follow. Kusakabe Taro, a young samurai from the province of Echizen, became the first Japanese to graduate from Rutgers College Phi Beta Kappa. Sadly, his degree was awarded posthumously as Kusakabe died of tuberculosis only weeks before commencement. Sub-series materials include clippings, correspondence and manuscripts relating to Kusakabe's experiences at Rutgers, and his Alumni Biographical files from the Class of 1870. 
Tadanari Matsudaira, lord of the Ueda clan in Shinshu, Central Japan, and his brother Tadaatsu, came to America in January 1872. Their wealthy family paid for them to come to the United States on to be educated, arranging for them to travel with the Iwakura Mission. While the group went on to Europe, both brothers stayed in the U.S. and Tadanari went to Rutgers College. He graduated with the Class of 1879. He then returned to Japan where he became governor of a province and an officer in the Department of Foreign Affairs. Tadaatsu married an American woman and became an engineer. This sub-series includes a Rutgers Alumni Biographical File, relating to the brothers. 
Kojiro Matsukata was born at Kagoshima, Japan in December 1865, son of the prominent Count N. Matsukata, Prime Minister of Japan from 1896 to 1897. He later became the founder of Kawasaki Heavy Industries and an art collector. Kojiro attended Rutgers Grammar School and Rutgers College, where he played for the football team. The series includes clippings, as well as two manuscripts, relating to history of the class of 1889, and a speech given by Matsukata in 1908. Also included is Matsukata's Rutgers Alumni Biographical File. There is also one oversize box of material comprising ephemera, newspaper clippings and photographic reproductions used for past exhibition. 
The sub-series Japanese Students includes correspondence, manuscripts, pamphlets and Rutgers Alumni Biographical Files for other individual Japanese students.
